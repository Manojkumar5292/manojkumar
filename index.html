    <h3><span>Title: </span>A WIRELESS SURVEILLANCE AND SAFETY SYSTEM FOR MINE 
WORKERS BASED ON ARDUINO</h3>
    <h3><span>Description: </span>
    The safety issues of coal mines have gradually turned into a major concern for the society 
and nation. Underground coal miners are exposed to a wide range of hazards including gas 
explosions, shifting rock, falls, and machinery and mobile equipment accidents. Coal as an 
important source of energy in industrial production, it plays a pivotal role in the national 
economy. Miner’s health and life is vulnerable to several critical issues, which includes not 
only the working environment, but also the after effect of it. To increase the productivity 
and reduce the cost of mining along with consideration of the safety of workers, an 
innovative approach is required. Coal mine safety monitoring system based on wireless 
sensor network can timely and accurately reflect dynamic situation of staff in the 
underground regions to ground computer system and mobile unit. A microcontroller is used 
here for gathering data and making decision, based on which the mine worker is informed 
through alarm as well as voice system. This project addresses a cost-effective, flexible 
solution for underground mine workers safety and established faithful communication 
system inside the underground mines</h3>
